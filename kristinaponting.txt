Who am I: I'm 64- 2025, started with blogging and the Internet in 1981, 
there it was called Intranet, at the University I went to, 
then came Sunet - what a miracle! After that I started with what it was called then, online journal, 
then it became a bunch of blogging tools of different kinds, after that I blogged for about 11 years before I switched to wordpress.
Today I run a number of blogs, affiliate marketing blogs and three of my own, one of which is still on blogspot. 
I will continue with coding and my blogs as long as it's fun.

Have fun with these .htacces security
